# EPFL Data science in practice 
This repository contains all notebooks done throughout the course Data science in practice at EPFL (MGT-415) in Spring 2020.

There are 4 folders: one for each problem set and one for the project.

The first two PS are data analysis works, while the last one focuses more on networks.

The project, whose name is The **Perfect Movie Recipe**, has the goal to analyse a Data Set about movies. The main structure of the project follows these steps:

- Data Wrangling
- Feature Engineering
- Data Analysis
- Classification and Regression (Prediction Models)

The project folder includes also the presentation's slides and the pdf of our report.

For all the 4 works, you can find a HTML version of the final version. 

Bye! :)
